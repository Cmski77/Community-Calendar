# CS410-16-SoftwareEngProject

This was a team based final project for my Software Engineering class at CCSU, using Scrum sprints. For local deployment and debugging, Netbeans was used. 


The project consists of two main parts: A web page that allows users to view a Google Calendar full of events and submit their own, and a web based admin control panel that would let users use CRUD on the database and publish events to the Google Calendar. Bootstrap was included for responsive design, and free CSS templates were utilized to achieve the right look and feel. 

Some of the code that I was involved with:
